# Scrim 2.0 Spec

so i want to make a bot for doing map voting for custom games in overwatch
yk how tf2 works?
rotate through modes
bot picks 3 maps in the current mode to give the players to vote from
this is all discord side no game integration (it would be impossible without a puppet overwatch client in a vm or some shit)

i was already floating around the idea of a bot that could assign teams and move people to vcs, but also let the person who is running pugs review the teams before the teams see so it’s a wheel to them but i can modify it last minute if it’s not balanaced
